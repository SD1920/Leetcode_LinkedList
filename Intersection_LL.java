/**
 * Problem Statement:
 * -----------------
 * Given two singly linked lists that may or may not intersect, find the node at which they intersect.
 * An intersection occurs when both linked lists share the same node (by reference, not just value).
 * If the lists do not intersect, return null.
 *
 * Example:
 * List 1: 100 -> 13 -> 5 -> 189 -> 8500 -> 560 -> 369
 *                         â†‘
 * List 2:      90 -> 93 -> 5
 *
 * In this example, the intersection point is at node with value 189.
